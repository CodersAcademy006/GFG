# DSA and Algorithms Solutions Repository

Welcome to the **DSA and Algorithms Solutions** repository!

This repository contains solutions to various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems and sprints available on the **GeeksforGeeks** website. All the solutions are implemented in Java, which is my core language and the one I am most comfortable with. Java's strong type system and object-oriented features make it an ideal choice for solving algorithmic problems effectively.

## Contents

- **Java Solutions**: Complete solutions for DSA and algorithm problems in Java.
- **Upcoming Languages**:
  - **C++**
  - **Python**
  - **JavaScript (Node.js)**

## Key Features

- **Java Solutions**: The majority of solutions are available in Java, providing a comprehensive resource for Java developers.
- **Future Languages**: Solutions in C++, Python, and JavaScript will be added soon to cater to a wider audience and different coding preferences.

## Current Status

- **Java Solutions**: While many solutions are provided, some may contain errors or be incomplete. I am continuously working on improving and updating the code.
- **Other Languages**: Solutions in C++, Python, and JavaScript are planned for future updates.
